A quick Google Maps mashup of two open datasets from [San Francisco](http://data.sfgov.org):

- [Street Tree List](http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/data.sfgov.org/2zah-tuvt)]
- [Mobile Food Facility Permit](http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/data.sfgov.org/6a9r-agq8)

Shady Eats allows you to look for food trucks near your current location that have street trees nearby to hide from the sun. Because you're a developer, and giant balls of hot fusion scare you. :)
